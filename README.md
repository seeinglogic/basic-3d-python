# Making 3D graphs, charts, and figures with Python

This is the companion repo to [this post](https://seeinglogic.com/posts/intro-to-3d-python/) on making basic 3D visuals with Python.

The three types of visuals are in each of the three folders:

1. [Making 3D Bar Charts with matplotlib](./bar_charts/)
1. [Network Graphs in 3D with networkx and matplotlib](./network_graphs/)
1. [Rendering a regular icosahedron with matplotlib](./icosahedron/)
