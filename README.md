# Making 3D graphs, charts, and figures with Python

This is the companion repo to [this post](https://seeinglogic.com/posts/python-3d-intro/) on making basic 3D visuals with Python.

Check out the [Jupyter Notebook](./demo_notebook.ipynb) for a more interactive experience.

Otherwise you can find each of the three visuals in the corresponding directories.
