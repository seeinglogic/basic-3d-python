# Making 3D graphs, charts, and figures with Python

This is the companion repo to [this post](https://seeinglogic.com/posts/intro-to-3d-python/) on making basic 3D visuals with Python.

There are three types of visuals, one in each of the three folders:

| ![3D Bar chart](./pictures/3d_bar_chart.png) [Making 3D Bar Charts with matplotlib](./bar_charts/) | ![Regular icosahedron](./pictures/icosahedron.png) [Network Graphs in 3D with networkx and matplotlib](./network_graphs/) | ![3D Network graph](./pictures/3d_network_graph.png) [Rendering a regular icosahedron with matplotlib](./icosahedron/) |
